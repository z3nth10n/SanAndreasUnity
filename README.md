# San Andreas Unity

We're porting [GTA: San Andreas](http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/) to Unity!

This won't be a complete re-implementation of the game, but we're hoping to build something similar to [Multi Theft Auto] with assets streamed from an existing installation of San Andreas.

## Setup Instructions

Before opening the project you'll need to run the [premake](http://premake.github.io/) script. A Windows binary is included, but for other platforms you'll need to install premake 5 yourself.

To run it on Windows, run `premake.bat`. On Mac and Linux, use `premake.sh`.
