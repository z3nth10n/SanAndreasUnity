This contains a little list with the features I think should be implemented on the future given its duration on its implementation:

### Vehicles

* Gear system (to make cars keep stoped on slopes)

* Boats, airplanes and bikes (+ fall)

### Mods system

* Integrate a mod system that is capable of reading source files and managed compiled assemblies, some exaples of mods:
    - Access to all interiors (without any yellow marker) generating them
    - Speedometer and rpm meter (like FO2) + fuel
    - GMOD physics and prop menu
    - Map editor
    - Ragdoll effects (like GTA IV) when falling and dying
    - Broke car windshield on hard impact
    - Animals (mobs)
    - Terrain modificable through digging & explosions
    - Territory (gan wars) on Multiplayer
    - Integration of UltraGTA
    - Some game crossover:
        - 7DTD / Unturned (survival, crafting, building, advanced zombies AI, looting, interior random generation, skills, money, buffs / broken bones)
        - GMOD (models, physics, gamemodes, modding)
        - MC (cave generation, mining...)
        - UltraGTA
        
### Gamemodes

- Survival
- Deathmatch
- Sandbox
